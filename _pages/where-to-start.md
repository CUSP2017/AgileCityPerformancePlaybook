title: Where To Start
---
For any performance management project to have an impact it has to have several
key characteristics:

- **Address decision maker's concern clearly**  
If the metric being used does not inform a decision maker, or give a frontline
worker a better sense of how well they are doing their job, the metric may not
be relevant. This can be the case even for metrics that feel important.

- **A clear feedback loop for improvement**  
A metric is not helpful in improving performance if there is not a clear path for
the city to improve it. Or, if improving it is outside the city's control. Performance
metrics should capture tangible statistics on the state of the city, and there should
be clear actions the city can take to move the metric in the right direction.

- **Sustainable process for data collection and dissemination**  
At the beginning of any project, particularly one that is introducing new processes
into an organization, the question of whether this new process will outlast the team
that is developing it is important to plan for. This is even more

- **Mandate for change (or the patience and boldness to work toward one)**  
Introducing a new process to any organization is a challenge. The introduction of
performance management can put people on the defensive and can make them resistant
to change if they feel their job is threatened. Finding solutions to these fears
is important. More then anything, the success of a performance management project
rests on the ability of individuals in an organization to rally around a new process.

### Start Small
It can be tempting to want to tackle all issues at once. There may be pressure from
decision makers above you to roll out a 'comprehensive' performance management system
from the beginning. Resist that urge. Focus on a narrow domain and get it right. This
is the best way to learn quickly what works and what does not.

> **Example:** A young mayor comes into office with a mandate for change. She wants to
see results, and fast, and tasks you with making it happen. Rather then try to address
all possible improvements at once, focus on the lowest hanging fruit. Is there an agency
with particularly good data already that has shown a willingness for change?
Is there a process in the City that is particularly burdensome for employees or citizens?
