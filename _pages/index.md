Not all cities are big. There are over *** cities in the United States with less
than 100,000 people. These cities represent % of all urban dwellers in the country.
This significant

We are calling these cities 'agile cities' to highlight an advantage smaller cities have
over their larger counterparts: the size to be agile. Unlike larger cities with sprawling
bureaucracies, civil servants in smaller cities have faster, more direct access to their
colleagues. In some instances, they may be the only one in the city doing their job.
Thus, the challenges they face under limited resources is also a strength. There are fewer
roadblocks in the way of change, and a small, committed team can make a significant
impact.

We're here to help you bunch above your weight.

The playbook can be explored in order, but the sections also stand on their own,
allowing a reader to dive into a topic that is most relevant right away.
