Not all American cities are big. There are over 1000 cities in the United States with a population
between 40,000 and 1 million people. These cities represent (??)% of all urban dwellers in the country.
These towns and villages are home to (??) million Americans. While America's largest
cities are experiencing new growth and economic vitality, many of the country's smaller
locations are left with dwindling populations, smaller budgets, and aging infrastructure.
How these cities respond to the growing challenge of limited resources will decide whether
small-town American finds its footing once more.

We are calling these towns and villages 'agile cities' to highlight an advantage smaller cities have
over their larger counterparts: the size to be agile. Unlike larger cities with sprawling
bureaucracies, civil servants in smaller cities have faster, more direct access to their
colleagues. In some instances, they may be the only one in the city doing their job.
Thus, the challenges they face under limited resources is also a strength. There are fewer
roadblocks in the way of change, and a small, committed team can make a significant
impact.

## Who This Is For

We hope this guide will prove helpful to smaller cities that have an interest in
implementing performance management techniques. The content of this guide is a combination
of best practices gleaned from other fantastic resources already online, but put into context
for smaller cities, and case studies and personal reflections from work undertaken
as part of a capstone project with NYU's [Center for Urban Science](http://cusp.nyu.edu) and
the [National Resource Network](http://nationalresourcenetwork.org). As part of this capstone,
our small team of graduate students worked with the cities of Cleveland Heights, OH (pop. ~50,000)
and New Bedford, MA (pop. ~95,000) on implementing small-scale performance metrics.

## The Playbook

This playbook provides a collection of best practices, useful advice, and
concrete examples on implementing performance management in a city with limited resources.
The playbook can be explored in order, but the sections also stand on their own,
allowing a reader to dive into a topic that is most relevant right away.
