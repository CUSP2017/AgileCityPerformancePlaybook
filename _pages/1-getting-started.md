title: 1. Getting Started

For any performance management project to have an impact it has to have several
key characteristics:

- **Address decision maker's concern clearly**  
If the metric being used does not inform a decision maker, or give a frontline
worker a better sense of how well they are doing their job, the metric may not
be relevant. This can even be the case for metrics that feel important or are commonly tracked.
Asking the right questions and [deciding on what to measure](2-deciding-what-to-measure.html) can
be the hardest part of the process.

- **A clear feedback loop for improvement**  
A metric is not helpful in improving performance if there is not a clear path for
the city to improve it or it is outside the city's control. Performance
metrics should capture tangible statistics on the state of the city, and there should
be clear actions the city can take to move the metric in the right direction. Once a
[positive feedback loop](positive-feedback-loops.md) is in place, improvements will
become a self-strengthening phenomenon.

- **Find the baseline**
Understanding where you're starting from is crucial to understanding if a city is improving or
getting worse. A baseline should also take into account the unique characteristics of a
given cityâ€“not all cities function the same, and understanding how yours can be
reasonably compared with others, and how it cannot, is harder then it might first
appear. Taking the time to [find the relevant baseline]() is

- **Sustainable process for data collection and dissemination**  
At the beginning of any project, particularly one that is introducing new processes
into an organization, the question of whether this new process will outlast the team
that is developing it is important to plan for. This is even more important in cities
where staff resources are limited. Setting up a maintainable [data pipeline](data-pipeline.md) will
help in guaranteeing [data quality](data-quality.md) so that metrics are trustworthy
and consistent. Finally, [documenting your process](documenting-your-process.md) goes a long way in
keeping the .

- **Mandate for change (or the patience and boldness to work toward one)**  
Introducing a new process to any organization is a challenge. The introduction of
performance management can put people on the defensive and can make them resistant
to change if they feel their job is threatened. Finding solutions to these fears
is important. More then anything, the success of a performance management project
rests on the ability of individuals in an organization to rally around a new process.

- **Start Small**
It can be tempting to want to tackle all issues at once. There may be pressure from
decision makers above you to roll out a 'comprehensive' performance management system
from the beginning. Resist that urge. Focus on a narrow domain and get it right. This
is the best way to learn quickly what works and what does not.

> **Example:** A young mayor comes into office with a mandate for change. She wants to
see results, and fast, and tasks you with making it happen. Rather then try to address
all possible improvements at once, focus on the lowest hanging fruit. Is there an agency
with particularly good data already that has shown a willingness for change?
Is there a process in the City that is particularly burdensome for employees or citizens?
