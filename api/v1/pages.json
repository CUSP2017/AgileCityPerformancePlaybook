There are over *** cities in the United States with less than 100,000 people. These cities represent % of all urban dwellers in the country. This significant We are calling these cities 'agile cities' to highlight an advantage smaller cities have over their larger counterparts: the size to be agile. Unlike larger cities with sprawling bureaucracies, civil servants in smaller cities have faster, more direct access to their colleagues. In some instances, they may be the only one in the city doing their job. Thus, the challenges they face under limited resources is also a strength. There are fewer roadblocks in the way of change, and a small, committed team can make a significant impact. We're here to help you bunch above your weight. The Playbook This playbook provides a collection of best practices, useful advice, and concrete examples on implementing performance management in a city with limited resources. The playbook can be explored in order, but the sections also stand on their own, allowing a reader to dive into a topic that is most relevant right away.

This can be the case even for metrics that feel important. A clear feedback loop for improvement A metric is not helpful in improving performance if there is not a clear path for the city to improve it. Or, if improving it is outside the city's control. Performance metrics should capture tangible statistics on the state of the city, and there should be clear actions the city can take to move the metric in the right direction. Sustainable process for data collection and dissemination At the beginning of any project, particularly one that is introducing new processes into an organization, the question of whether this new process will outlast the team that is developing it is important to plan for. This is even more Mandate for change (or the patience and boldness to work toward one) Introducing a new process to any organization is a challenge. The introduction of performance management can put people on the defensive, can make , and is only effective if the entire organization rallies around the change. More then anything, the success of a performance management project rests on the ability for individuals in an organization to Start Small It can be tempting to want to tackle all issues at once. There may be pressure from decision makers above you to roll out a 'comprehensive' performance management system from the beginning. Resist that urge. Focus on a narrow domain and get it right. This is the best way to learn quickly what works and what does not. Then, success in one area can help to generate more political capital to support further applications. Example: A young mayor comes into office with a mandate for change. She wants to see results, and fast, and tasks you with making it happen. Rather then try to address all possible improvements at once, focus on the lowest hanging fruit. Is there an agency with particularly good data already that has shown a willingness for change? Is there a process in the City that is particularly burdensome for employees or citizens? Does Deciding What To Track Keeping the"}]}
